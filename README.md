# Open Source Software for Multifold Nuclei Analysis
Nuclei are essential components of cells and contain vital genetic information. Analyzing nuclei can provide valuable insights into cellular processes, disease mechanisms, and the development of new therapies. Nuclei segmentation, detection, and classification enable researchers to study the morphology, spatial distribution, and properties of nuclei, aiding in understanding diseases such as cancer, neurological disorders, and developmental abnormalities.

Nuclei analysis plays a role in drug discovery and development processes. By segmenting and classifying nuclei, researchers can assess the effect of drugs on cellular structures, measure cell viability, evaluate drug toxicity, and screen potential therapeutic compounds. It enables the identification and characterization of cellular responses and provides valuable data for drug efficacy studies.

Nuclei segmentation, detection, and classification tasks are part of broader image analysis and computer vision research. Developing accurate and efficient algorithms for these tasks contributes to advancements in image processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. These advancements can benefit other image-based applications beyond nuclei analysis, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image analysis.

Here, we curated a multifold set of algorithms which provide researchers full access to an open source software which allows for effective and efficient nuclei analysis.
