# 3D-DGAN-Genome-Scale-Imaging
Genomic instability enables cells to acquire genetic alterations that promote oncogenesis. Chromatin plays central roles in both transcriptional regulation and the maintenance of genomic stability. Here, we present a novel genome scale imaging technique using 3D to 2D DGAN image translation work for processing genomic landscapes.
